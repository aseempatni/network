-----------------------------------
Impact of packet size:
-----------------------------------

timeLastTPacket
	remains same

delaySum
	increases slightly

timesForwarded
	always zero in case of our experiment

rBytes
	increases, which is obvious

timeFirstTPacket
	independent of interval

bytesDropped
	always zero in our case

timeFirstRPacket
	independent of interval, which is obvious

lostPackets
	never lost

tPackets
	same

tBytes
	increases, obvious

rPackets
	same

recieverThroughput
	increases linearly

packetsDropped
	always zero

transmitterThroughput
	increases linearly

timeLastRPacket
	increases slightly with increase in time interval

------------------------------
Impact of intervals:
-----------------------------

timeLastTPacket
	reduces a bit, but almost the same

delaySum
	reduces

timesForwarded
	always zero in case of our experiment

rBytes
	reduces, which is obvious

timeFirstTPacket
	independent of interval

bytesDropped
	always zero in our case

timeFirstRPacket
	independent of interval, which is obvious

lostPackets
	never lost

tPackets
	reduces

tBytes
	reduces

rPackets
	reduces

recieverThroughput
	reduces

packetsDropped
	always zero

transmitterThroughput
	reduces

timeLastRPacket
	reduces slightly with increase in time interval
