Result / Data
-----------------------

The data is in file "data"

Schema:

Each data point is in three lines as following

Line 1 | Data Generation RAte
Line 2 | Average Values in order throughput, forwarding delay and jitter.
Line 2 | Standard deviation Values in order throughput, forwarding delay and jitter.

Analysis
-----------------------

From the results and looking at the plots, we can observe the following trends with the increase in data generation rate:


* Average Forwarding Delay first increases with the increase in data generation rate and then decreases at slow rate.

* The trend in the confidence interval of forwarding delay is also similar.

* Jitter first increases very fast with the increase in the data generation rate and the decreases exponentially.

* The confidence interval is more when the average jitter is more.

* The peak of mean jitter is slightly before the peak of the confidence interval for its value.

* Throughput increases almost linearly with the increase in data generation rate.

* The confidence interval also increases slightly with it.
